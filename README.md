# Scrape Nests

Scrape bird info from the [Guide to North American Birds](https://www.audubon.org/bird-guide) created by [National Audubon Society](https://www.audubon.org/) . Hobby project to get familiar with Python programming language (snakes are cool too).

Please consider donating to [The Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://give.birds.cornell.edu/page/87895/donate/) and / or [National Audubon Society](https://act.audubon.org/a/donate?ms=digital-fund-web-website_nas-topmenu_donate_202107) to protect our birds.

FYI: "Scrape Nest" is a type of bird nest where birds just "scrape" the ground to make a depression as their nest.
