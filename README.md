# Scrape Nests

Scrape bird info from the [Bird Guide](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/browse/taxonomy/) created by [The Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/)

FYI: "Scrape Nest" is a type of bird nest where birds just "scrape" the ground to make a depression as their nest.
